### Assignment #009 Basic GUI with TKinter (Total Marks 13)

Objectives:
* To apply class and object instantiation to the tkinter GUI class
* Plan a user interface using tkinter geometry tools
* Explore alternative methods for creating and placing objects

TKinter is a class that can be used to create a graphical user interface
in Python.  It is cross platform, meaning that all gui's created make
use of the local operating system to build its user interface, so a 
Python app built on a Mac will look like a Mac app.

All of the features that can be added to an app window are called widgets,
and these include buttons, entry boxes, text boxes, and even some
structures like Frames that are just for organizing and grouping other widgets.

Once we define a widget, we have to configure its options and then find the
best way to display the widget in the window.
Today we will explore the 3 ways of placing widgets:
.pack()
.grid()
.place()

If at any time you want to find out more about a widget, you can search for
its options on the Internet.

For example:
to find out about the Button widget, you might search for tkinter.Button()
to find out more about how the .place() method works, search tkinter.place()


### 3 Tasks

##### Task 1
Create the user interface described in the image task1.png.
You should use only the .pack() or .grid() methods
(2 points) 

##### Task 2
Create the user interface described in the image task2.png.
This image was created using the .grid() method, but you can
use .pack() or .place() also
(5 points)

##### Task 3
Create the user interface described in the image task3.png
using the .grid() method
(3 points)

##### Task 4
Create the user interface described in the image task3.png
using the .place() method
(3 points)
